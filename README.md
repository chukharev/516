## Course Assessment Plan

- Participation: 20%
- Four small projects: 10% each, 40% total (rubric provided on the assignment sheet for each small project)
- Oral exam based on the small projects: 20% (rubric provided on the study guide)
- Written final exam: 20% (rubric provided on the study guide)

## Course Policies

**Collaborative work.** You may use the help of others to work on your projects. However, you must retain
ownership (authorship) of the code that you submit. If someone helps you write a fragment of your code,
the best way to ensure that you retain ownership is to re-write that fragment of code on your own without
looking at the code that your helper wrote for you. If you borrow code from an online source, you should
cite that source in a comment.

The oral exam will be used to ascertain your ownership of the code that you have submitted.

**Attendance and participation.** There is no automatic points deduction for missing class. However, 20% of your grade is based on attendance and participation.
You are expected to participate in all class activities.
You must complete all coursework regardless of your presence in class.
Please be aware that regular class attendance and active participation is a strong predictor of your final grade
(i.e. non-attending and non-participating students have historically received low grades in this course).

## Assignment Sheets

### Small Project 1

Chapter 1, Ex. 24, 25

Put the code for both exercises into a single Python file named **project1.py** and upload this file to your GitHub repository for feedback and grading. Add comments to each meaningful section of the program explaining your approach.

Grading (10 points total)
- Your program is syntactically correct: 3 points.
- Your program produces the correct output: 5 points.
- Your program is optimally written: 2 points.

Deadline:
- Submissions are expected by October 1.
- There will be no penalty for late submissions.

### Small Project 2

Chapter 2, Ex. 18, 19

Put the code for both exercises into a single Python file named **project2.py** and upload this file to your GitHub repository for feedback and grading. Add comments to each meaningful section of the program explaining your approach.

Grading (10 points total)
- Your program is syntactically correct: 3 points.
- Your program produces the correct output: 5 points.
- Your program is optimally written: 2 points.

Deadline:
- Submissions are expected by November 12.
- There will be no penalty for late submissions.

### Small Project 3

Write a script in Python that converts British spelling of a text to the American spelling using at least two generalizable replacement patterns. "Generalizable" means applicable to more than one lexeme. For example, replacing "fireman" with "firefighter" is not generalizable, but replacing "theatre" with "theater" is. Your script should read an input text file and write an output text file. The names of the input and output files may be hard-coded in the script.

Grading (10 points total)
- Your program is syntactically correct: 3 points.
- Your program produces the correct output: 5 points.
- Your program is optimally written: 2 points.

Deadline:
- Submissions are expected by December 3.
- There will be no penalty for late submissions.

### Small Project 4

Group projects as discussed in class.

### General Notes

#### Submission deadlines

#### Submission procedure

I will access your GitHub
repository after the deadline to retrieve your project file. For each small project, create a file
in your GitHub repository named **projectx.py**, where **x** is the number of the project (**1**-**4**).
Your file name should not contain quotes, spaces,
or any other symbols. Please also note that file names are case sensitive,
so "PROJECT1.PY" and "project1.py" are two different files.
