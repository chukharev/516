## Course Assessment Plan

- Participation: 20%
- Four small projects: 10% each, 40% total (rubric provided on the assignment sheet for each small project)
- Oral exam based on the small projects: 20% (rubric provided on the study guide)
- Written final exam: 20% (rubric provided on the study guide)

## Course Policies

**Collaborative work.** You may use the help of others to work on your projects. However, you must retain
ownership (authorship) of the code that you submit. If someone helps you write a fragment of your code,
the best way to ensure that you retain ownership is to re-write that fragment of code on your own without
looking at the code that your helper wrote for you. If you borrow code from an online source, you should
cite that source in a comment.

The oral exam will be used to ascertain your ownership of the code that you have submitted.

**Attendance and participation.** There is no automatic points deduction for missing class. However, 20% of your grade is based on attendance and participation.
You are expected to participate in all class activities.
You must complete all coursework regardless of your presence in class.
Please be aware that regular class attendance and active participation is a strong predictor of your final grade
(i.e. non-attending and non-participating students have historically received low grades in this course).

## Assignment Sheets

### Small Project 1
- Ex. 24, 25
- More information forthcoming

### General Notes

#### Submission deadlines

#### Submission procedure

I will access your GitHub
repository after the deadline to retrieve your project file. For each small project, create a file
in your GitHub repository named **projectx.py**, where **x** is the number of the project (**1**-**4**).
Your file name should not contain quotes, spaces,
or any other symbols. Please also note that file names are case sensitive,
so "PROJECT1.PY" and "project1.py" are two different files.
