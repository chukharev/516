# Set up a GitHub account

Please follow the steps below:

### Step 1. Register for a free GitHub account

- Go to github.com
- Under "Sign up", you are asked to pick a username. Select a username by which you would be known on the GitHub site. (If possible and to avoid confusion, you may want to select a username identical or similar to your ISU net-id.)
- On the "Welcome to GitHub" screen, choose the "Free" plan ($0), click "Continue".
- You may skip the "Tailor your experience" step.
- You will need to verify your email address. Please check your CyMail and click on the link in a verification email from GitHub.
- Once your email address is verified, you will be taken to the main page of your GitHub account.

### Step 2. Create a new repository

- Click "New repository" on the left.
- Under "Repository name", enter "516" (without quotes). This will be the name of your repository.
- Leave all other options as default.
- Click "Create repository"
- You will now be taken to the main page your new GitHub repository. Find the line that says "Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file". Click on "creating a new file".
- Under "Name your file", enter "index.md" (without quotes)
= In the text editor under "Edit new file", enter "Hello, world!" (without quotes)
- Scroll down to the bottom and click the green button "Commit new file"

### Step 3. Set up GitHub Pages
- Click the "Settings" tab at the top
- Click "Pages" on the left
- Under "Source", select "main"
- Click "Save"

### Step 4. Check if you've done everything correctly

Wait for a couple of minutes to make sure all changes are applied, then go to: https://yourusername.github.io/516/ (replace yourusername with the username you selected in step 1)
If you see "Hello, world!", congratulations! You have successfully completed this step.
